## Plans


### signaling accross models

Pan cancer:
	-> significant LR -> filter for expressed in PCa lines (LNCAPCLONE, PC3) -> List1
PDX:
	-> Significant LR -> List2
	
-> Overlap{list1,list2} -> Which can be inhibited? are soluble -> TopN results

- add to topN list, secreted, membrane bound information (localistation column)


### Subtyping with NMF

- (maybe AR-score, NE-score for each cell-line ->  match with subtypes?)
- (maybe add belonding to pathways (ligand or receptor) info to heatmap, or just create list)


- TopN for each subtype (CR, CS, NE)


### patient samples

- focus on primary vs CRPC comparison
